### Features

* Simple configuration
* Zero-downtime config reload with `SIGHUP`

### Quick Example

Given `google.json`

``` json
{
  "/search": {
    "url": "https://www.google.com/search?q={{q}}",
    "list": "#search ol > li",
    "item": {
      "title": "h3 a",
      "url": ["h3 a","@href"]
    }
  }
}
```

``` sh
$ scraper google.json
listening on 3000...
```

``` sh
$ curl localhost:3000/search?q=helloworld
# [
#  json results...
# ]
```

### Configuration

``` plain
{
  <path>: {
    "url": <url>
    "list": <selector>,
    "item": {
      <field>: <selector>,
      <field>: <selector>,
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

* `<path>` - **Required** The URI path of this scraper GET endpoint
  * You may define path variables like: `/my/path/:var` when set to `/my/path/foo` then `:var = "foo"`
* `<url>` - **Required** The URL of the remote server
  * It may contain template variables in the form `{{ var }}`, scraper will look for a `var` path variable, if not found, it will then look for a query parameter `var`
* `list` - **Optional** When defined, a JSON array will be returned with each `item`, where each element selected is used as the DOM root.
* `item` - **Required** Returns a JSON object with each field defined using their corresponding selectors.
  * Uses the first item from the selection
* `<selector>` - Returns a string by parsing the provided config
  * array selectors must contain a series of string selectors
  * string selectors are parsed in the following order:
    * `/abc/` is viewed as a regexp
    * `abc` is viewed as a CSS selector
    * `@abc` is viewed as an attribute name
    * resulting DOM nodes are converted to strings using their text value
